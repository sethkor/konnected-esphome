# INTRODUCTION
# 
# This ESPHome based firmware configuration is designed for the Konnected Garage Door Opener v1,
# but can also run on any ESP8266 device. The Garage Door Opener retrofits an older style traditional
# garage door opener and has the following features which are included as packages below:
#
# 1. Wired contact sensor for detecting open/closed state of garage door
# 2. Optical range sensor for detecting open/closed state of garage door
# 3. Emulates a garage door opener button wired to a dry contact relay to open/close the garage door.
# 4. Adds a Garage Door "Cover" entity that is exposed to Home Assistant. The cover entity incorporates the state of the 
#    garage door and controls to open/close/stop it.
# 5. Flashes an onboard LED and beeps an onboard piezo sounder as a warning before automatically closing.

  ####
  # NAME
  # By default, the name of the ESPHome device is "garage-door-xxxxxx" where xxxxxx is a unique identifier. The device's
  # hostname on your network is also defined by the name, defaulting to "garage-door-xxxxxx.local". Edit this variable to
  # customize the name and hostname. Note: only lowercase characters, numbers and hyphen(-) are allowed.
